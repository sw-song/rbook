# Intro to R


R is one of the best language for statistics. Sometimes it is compared with python, but being able to handle r is a huge advantage for anyone who works with data and statistics.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
